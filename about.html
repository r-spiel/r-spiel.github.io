<img src="Richelle.jpg" alt="Richelle Spiel Photo" title="Richelle Spiel" 
style="width:250px; float:left; padding:10px;">

<p><br />Hello!  My name is Richelle, and I am a work in progress.  <br /> <br />
    Some of my friends call me a ‚Äúhype person‚Äù because my enthusiasm can be so 
    infectious üòÑ.  I am currently super enthusiastic about tech writing and learning 
    to code!  
    I have loved teaching myself HTML and CSS in my free time from books and 
    online resources (check my projects page for details).  I am now diving into 
    learning Ruby while tinkering with this website.  I am 
    currently working full time and seeking employment as a Technical Writer.  
    <br /> <br />
    
    I‚Äôve lived in Seattle for the last 15 years, attending the University of 
    Washington where I got a Bachelor‚Äôs in Economics and History in 2011.  
    I have worked in teaching, finance and sales (check out my LinkedIn for more 
    details) - but what I have learned from them all is that I love learning, 
    building, problem solving and working collaboratively with people.  <br /> <br />
    
    When I am coding, my favorite part when I am on the cusp of 
    solving a problem.  These moments give me momentum and build my anticipation 
    for solving whatever problem I have encountered. I have seen with editing my 
    own code that solving one problem can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, 
    this really drives me to learn more about the relationship between all the 
    code that I am using so that I can make any project I am working on look and 
    work just the way I want it to.  <br /> <br />

    I built this site by writing the code in HTML & CSS (in the text editor VS 
    Code), and hosting my code for free on GitHub Pages.  You can read about some 
    of the articles 
    that helped me build this site by clicking this <a href="01htmlcss.html">link</a> 
    or by using the "Projects" drop down menu above and selecting HTML & CSS.  
    This website is not perfect, and is a constant work in progress, just like me!  
    Things should change on this site from time to time as I fine tune the code 
    and design of the site and as I build more projects to write about!  
    Hopefully as you check back you will begin to see some changes and improvements.  
    <br /> <br />

    One of my passions is listening to podcasts, audio books and reading (my daily 
    commute gives me a good chance to get some audio listening in).  Below you 
    can check out some books and audio that I am currently listening to.  I find that 
    audio books & Podcasts are a great way to broaden my world view and learn things.  
    I am always looking for a discussion partner, so let me know if you are also 
    listening to any of these!  <br /> <br />
    
    Thank you for visiting!  Keep up with my journey right here on my website.

                <i>The astonishing sequel to Children of Time, the award-winning novel of humanity's battle for survival on a terraformed planet.

                    Thousands of years ago, Earth's terraforming program took to the stars. On the world they called Nod, scientists discovered alien life - but it was their mission to overwrite it with the memory of Earth. Then humanity's great empire fell, and the program's decisions were lost to time.
                    
                    Aeons later, humanity and its new spider allies detected fragmentary radio signals between the stars. They dispatched an exploration vessel, hoping to find cousins from old Earth.
                    
                    But those ancient terraformers woke something on Nod better left undisturbed.
                    
                    And it's been waiting for them.  </i>
