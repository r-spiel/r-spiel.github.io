        <p><br />Hello!  My name is Richelle, my pronouns are she/her and I am a work in progress.  <br /><br />

        Some of my friends call me a ‚Äúhype person‚Äù because my enthusiasm can be so infectious üòÑ.  I am currently a student at <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a> in Seattle and am super enthusiastic about learning to code and starting a new career as a Software Engineer!  I love the thrill I get from solving a problem with code and sense of pride when things are working.  
        
        <br /><br />I‚Äôve lived in Seattle for the last 15 years, where I attended the University of Washington getting a Bachelor‚Äôs in Economics and History in 2011 and Master's degree in Teaching (Elementary) in 2015.  I have worked in finance, teaching, and sales (manufacturing) - but what I have learned from them all is that I love learning, building, problem solving and working collaboratively with people.  I am passionate about social justice, and hope to do my part to remove barriers for others and make a positive impact on my community.  I am so honored and excited to be part of <a href="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/">Ada Developers Academy</a> and to start my career as a Software Engineer. <br /><br />

        <br />Please check out my <a href="portfolio.html">portfolio</a> page to learn more about some of the projects that I have done during my time at Ada. Prior to joining Ada, I taught myself HTML, CSS, and some Ruby fundamentals while working full time.  

        <br /><br />Ada is a fullstack web development bootcamp, I don't think I can say it better than it is already said on the Ada website:  
        <blockquote cite="https://adadevelopersacademy.org/what-to-expect/"><h3>"</h3>Ada Developers Academy teaches full-stack web development, allowing students to choose what specialty of software development they want to pursue in their post-Ada careers. We cover HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Ruby on Rails, and Computer Science fundamentals. The complete curriculum is online and open-source.<h3>"</h3></blockquote>
