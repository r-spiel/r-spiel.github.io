<img src="Richelle.jpg" alt="Richelle Spiel Photo" title="Richelle Spiel" 
style="width:250px; float:left; padding:10px;">

<p><br />Hello!  My name is Richelle, and I am a work in progress.  <br /> <br />
    Some of my friends call me a ‚Äúhype person‚Äù because my enthusiasm can be so 
    infectious üòÑ.  I am currently super enthusiastic about tech writing and learning 
    to code!  
    I have loved teaching myself HTML and CSS in my free time from books and 
    online resources (check my projects page for details).  I am now diving into 
    learning Ruby while tinkering with this website.  I am 
    currently working full time and seeking employment as a Technical Writer.  
    <br /> <br />
    
    I‚Äôve lived in Seattle for the last 13 years, attending the University of 
    Washington where I got a Bachelor‚Äôs in Economics and History in 2011.  
    I have worked in teaching, finance and sales (check out my LinkedIn for more 
    details) - but what I have learned from them all is that I love learning, 
    building, problem solving and working collaboratively with people.  <br /> <br />
    
    When I am coding, my favorite part when I am on the cusp of 
    solving a problem.  These moments give me momentum and build my anticipation 
    for solving whatever problem I have encountered. I have seen with editing my 
    own code that solving one problem can sometimes lead to unintended consequences, 
    this really drives me to learn more about the relationship between all the 
    code that I am using so that I can make any project I am working on look and 
    work just the way I want it to.  <br /> <br />

    I built this site by writing the code in HTML & CSS (in the text editor VS 
    Code), and hosting my code for free on GitHub Pages.  You can read about some 
    of the articles 
    that helped me build this site by clicking this <a href="01htmlcss.html">link</a> 
    or by using the "Projects" drop down menu above and selecting HTML & CSS.  
    This website is not perfect, and is a constant work in progress, just like me!  
    Things should change on this site from time to time as I fine tune the code 
    and design of the site and as I build more projects to write about!  
    Hopefully as you check back you will begin to see some changes and improvements.  
    <br /> <br />

    One of my passions is listening to podcasts, audio books and reading (my daily 
    commute gives me a good chance to get some audio listening in).  Below you 
    can check out some books and audio that I am currently listening to.  I find that 
    audio books & Podcasts are a great way to broaden my world view and learn things.  
    I am always looking for a discussion partner, so let me know if you are also 
    listening to any of these!  <br /> <br />
    
    Thank you for visiting!  Keep up with my journey right here on my website.

                <b>Stamped from the Beginning:The Definitive History of Racist Ideas 
                in America</b></a> by Ibram X. Kendi <br />
                Amazon summary: <br />
                <i>The National Book Award winning history of how racist ideas were created, 
                spread, and deeply rooted in American society.  Some Americans insist that 
                we're living in a post-racial society. But racist thought is not just alive and 
                well in America--it is more sophisticated and more insidious than ever. And as 
                award-winning historian Ibram X. Kendi argues, racist ideas have a long and 
                lingering history, one in which nearly every great American thinker is complicit.
                <br />
                As Kendi shows, racist ideas did not arise from ignorance or hatred. They were 
                created to justify and rationalize deeply entrenched discriminatory policies 
                and the nation's racial inequities.</i>

                But all is not right in this new Eden. In the long years since the planet was abandoned, 
                the work of its architects has borne disastrous fruit. The planet is not waiting for them 
                pristine and unoccupied. New masters have turned it from a refuge into mankind's worst 
                nightmare.  Now two civilizations are on a collision course, both testing the boundaries 
                of what they will do to survive. As the fate of humanity hangs in the balance, who are the
