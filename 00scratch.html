                by Max Wainewright <br /><i>PSA&#8208; this book although good, is written from an older 
                version of Scratch so some of the instructions & images are out of date.  However, I still 
                found it useful.</i></li>

        <p>My first coding project, in February 2019, was making a game in Scratch.  I was working on the 
            EdX course: <i>Harvard's CS50 Intro to Computer Science</i>, where the Week 0 assignment is to 
            make a game in Scratch within certain parameters. I found this to be a very fun and educational 
            experience!  After listening to the Week 0 lecture, I started out in Scratch creating one of 
            the Level One games from the book <i>Code Your Own Games!: 20 Games to Create with Scratch</i>.  
            This helped me learn the basics of Scratch before moving on to my own creation.  I was able 
            to create the game that I submitted for this assignment (linked below) in one full Saturday after 
            many hours of work.  I loved the process and knew I wanted to learn more about coding!  This 
            assignment also introduced me to core concepts like loops, variables and conditions.  
            Although I only completed Week 0 of the course before moving on to learn HTML & CSS in order to 
            code this website, I am still very glad that I did it!  It was a great introduction and a lot of
            fun.  </p>

        <p> Play the game embedded below, or click <b><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/287527364" 
            target="_blank">here</a></b> to play it in Scractch where you can also see the 
            code that makes it work.  All the graphics and images are of course part of the MIT Scratch 
            library which makes it such a fun coding program to play with.  <b>**HINT**</b> - the keys can 
            sometimes hide behind the counters!  Not sure why, but it seems to happen often.  Sound 
            ON for the best experience!  ;)  <br /> </p>
