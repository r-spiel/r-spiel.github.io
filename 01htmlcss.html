        <p>After coding a few games in <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/ target="blank">Scratch</a> which was so fun, I felt like 
        I was ready to take on a more legitmate coding language to expand my skills. 
        <br />
        Initially I started to learn Python, but I really wanted to build something that I could link to, 
        something that I could use as a future portfolio.  So I decided that building my own website 
        from scratch via HTML & CSS would be a great start!  
        <br />
        Keep reading to learn the 13 steps I took to this website.  Below is a list of the main resources which 
        have helped me, however I will link to other articles that helped me with some tricky details 
        &#40;like the navigation bar&rpar; throughout this page.

        <p>
            Iâ€™ll take you through the general order in which I built the different parts 
            of this website in 13 steps.  I will mention that I wish I had more screen 
            shots from the beginning!  So for those of you building a website from scratch, 
            take screen shots!  Itâ€™s really fun to think about how far you have come. 
            Unfortunately, I do not have screen shots for every step.  

            <ol>
                <li><b>Basic Understandings</b>: My first step was to gain a basic 
                    understanding of how to build a website.  I did this by reading through 
                    the first parts of John Duckett's book a couple times until I felt 
                    like I had a decent understanding of how websites work - I learned 
                    that I needed a domain name and I needed a host and those are 2 
                    completely separate things.  </li>
                <li><b>Domain Name:</b> I bought my domain: richellespiel.com from google 
                    domains for $12 per year.  <i>*Note - you can host your site on 
                        GitHub pages without using a custom domain name, it's not required 
                        but it was something I wanted, so I went for it. </i> 
                </li>
                <li>
                    <b>Free Web Host:</b> Next, I searched for a host for my site.  
                    I actually had a hard time finding a host and spent a week or two 
                    stuck right here, wondering how do people ever write websites from 
                    scratch!  Every host I researched had all these templates with click 
                    and fill boxes (like wordpress etc.).  I didnâ€™t want this!  I wanted 
                    to write all the code myself.  Finally I stumbled onto a blog 
                    post where I learned about GitHub Pages.  That was a huge relief.  
                    GitHub pages is free, you can host a static website through your 
                    GitHub account and you can use a custom domain!  I felt like it was 
                    a little tricky to get everything working correctly.  I used these 
                    resources to work it all out: <br />

                    style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);" >GitHub Pages</a> <br />

                    style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);" >Using custom domain for GitHub pages</a> 
                    -  a Medium article by Hossain Khan<br />
                    *<a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" 
                    style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);" >VS Code</a> - I used the VS Code text editor to write my code. <br /> 
                    * I used GitHub Desktop to push my changes to my GitHub repository.  <br />
                    <i>While I list this in one step, in reality, it took me a while to 
                        work out all these details.  There was a lot of researching and trial 
                        and error.  
                    </i><br />
                    After all these logistics, after LOTS of trial and error, when I finally 
                    typed in my domain and saw this, I laughed with relief.  I was so proud!  ðŸ˜‚

                    I even shared this some friends - their reaction: slow. clap.
