        <p>After coding a few games in <a href=https://scratch.mit.edu/ target="blank">Scratch</a> which was so fun, I felt like 
        I was ready to take on a more legitmate coding language to expand my skills. 
        <br />
        Initially I started to learn Python, but I really wanted to build something that I could link to, 
        something that I could use as a future portfolio.  So I decided that building my own website 
        from scratch via HTML & CSS would be a great start!  
        <br />
        Keep reading to learn the 13 steps I took to this website.  Below is a list of the main resources which 
        have helped me, however I will link to other articles that helped me with some tricky details 
        &#40;like the navigation bar&rpar; throughout this page.

            I‚Äôll take you through the general order in which I built the different parts 
            of this website in 13 steps.  I will mention that I wish I had more screen 
            shots from the beginning!  So for those of you building a website from scratch, 
            take screen shots!  It‚Äôs really fun to think about how far you have come. 
            Unfortunately, I do not have screen shots for every step.  

            <!--Beginning of 13 steps to build this site-->
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <b>Basic Understandings</b>: My first step was to gain a basic 
                    understanding of how to build a website.  I did this by reading through 
                    the first parts of John Duckett's book, HTML & CSS, a couple times until I felt 
                    like I had a decent understanding of how websites work - I learned 
                    that I needed a domain name and I needed a host and those are 2 
                    completely separate things.  </li><br />
                <li>
                    <b>Domain Name:</b> I bought my domain: richellespiel.com from google 
                    domains for $12 per year.  <i>*Note - you can host your site on 
                        GitHub pages without using a custom domain name, it's not required 
                        but it was something I wanted, so I went for it. </i> 
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    <b>Free Web Host:</b> Next, I searched for a host for my site.  
                    I actually had a hard time finding a host and spent a week or two 
                    stuck right here, wondering how do people ever write websites from 
                    scratch!  Every host I researched had all these templates with click 
                    and fill boxes (like wordpress etc.).  I didn‚Äôt want this!  I wanted 
                    to write all the code myself.  Finally I stumbled onto a blog 
                    post where I learned about GitHub Pages.  That was a huge relief.  
                    GitHub pages is free, you can host a static website through your 
                    GitHub account and you can use a custom domain!  I felt like it was 
                    a little tricky to get everything working correctly.  I used these 
                    resources to work it all out: <br />

                    -  a Medium article by Hossain Khan<br />
                    ‚û°Ô∏è <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" title="code.visualstudio.com" target="_blank" 
                    style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);" >VS Code</a> - I used the VS Code text 
                    editor to write my code. <br /> 
                    ‚û°Ô∏è I used GitHub Desktop to push my changes to my GitHub repository.  <br />
                    <i>While I list this in one step, in reality, this process took me a while to 
                        work out all these details.  There was a lot of researching and trial 
                        and error.  
                    </i><br />
                    After all these logistics, after LOTS of trial and error, when I finally 
                    typed in my domain and saw this, I laughed with relief.  I was so proud!  üòÇ <br />
                    <img src="HelloWorldSitePic.png" alt="image of the first version of this site, 
                    which only said Hello World" title="Hello World, the first rendition of my site!"

                </li><br />
                <li>
                    <b>Linking to pages:</b> Now that I knew where to write my code (in VS Code), 
                    and how to upload it to be hosted on GitHub (via GitHub Desktop), I needed to 
                    start to lay out the map for the site by adding different pages.  I decided to 
                    build a Bio page, and a resources page.  Pg. 80 of the Duckett book was 
                    helpful.  At this stage, the links to these new pages were listed in bullet point
                    format on the home page.  Each page is coded in a separate HTML document.  <br />
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    <b>CSS:</b> Once I had a few different pages on my site, I decided that I was 
                    ready to add some style.  I started reading about CSS and began googling 
                    things like "best website colors" which returned some great resources and 
                    hexcodes (color codes) for me to use on my site!  I followed the advice in the 
                    Duckett book, and made my CSS style sheet a separate file from my HTML and 
                    linked to it.  <br />
                    At this point I also started experimenting with adding a Navigation Bar at the top. <br />
                    <img src="LinktoStyleSheet.png" alt="image of the code to linke to Style Sheet" 
                    title="Link to style sheet - separate .CSS file" width="300px"> 
                    <img src="oldversionwebsite.jpg"  alt="image of older version of this site, with basic 
                    nav and links" width="320px"><br /> 
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    <b>Navigation Bar & Footer:</b> Starting with the footer, I decided that this would 
                    help my site look more legitimate.  After trying 1 tutorial that didn‚Äôt work for me, 
                    I found <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_footer.asp" 
                    title="https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_css_fixed_footer.asp" target="_blank" 
                    style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);" >this</a> tutorial from W3Schools about footers 
                    was very helpful.  I then decided to tackle the Navigation Bar.  This was a little 
                    more tricky for me.  I started out using <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" 
                    title="https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_navbar.asp" target="_blank" 
                    style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);" >this</a> tutorial from W3 Schools.  
                    And then once I added my dropdown menu, I re-wrote it all in div elements 
                    to make it work better (link to that later on).  <br />
                    Having the nav bar and footer was a great feeling!! üéâüéâüéâ  It really made the site 
                    look and function so much more professionally!  The Nav Bar was even responsive - 
                    where if you hovered over one of the links it would change color!  I was very proud.  
                </li><br />
                <li>
                    <b>Logos & Icons:</b> To further develop the Nav Bar and Footer, I decided to add 
                    the icons for GitHub & LinkedIn to link directly to my profiles in the Nav Bar.  
                    I also added the icon for GitHub Pages in the footer.  I made sure to get all my 
                    icons directly from the respective sites, since most social sites like this have 
                    publically available icons that they want people to use for this exact purpose.  
                    If you click the icons below they will take you to those pages (where you can downlaod 
                    the icons), if you click the icons in my Navigation bar, they will take you to my 
                    respective GitHub & LinkedIn profiles.  <br />

                <li>
                    <b>Custom Font:</b> I decided to add a bit more personality by choosing a 
                    custom font for my name at the top. <br /><br />
                    <div id="font-demo">This font is called

                    <b>Text Overline & Blend Mode - A CSS Tangent:</b> While I was researching the way I wanted my kind of 
                    "splash page" or name to look with my fancy custom font, I became inspired by this 
                    <a href="https://codepen.io/ngonzalesdesign/pen/vvRMJV" target="blank" 
                    title="https://codepen.io/ngonzalesdesign/pen/vvRMJV" style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);">
                    CodePen by Natasha Gonzales</a>.  I found it while reading this article called 
                    <a href="https://speckyboy.com/css-blend-mode/" target="blank" 
                    title="https://speckyboy.com/css-blend-mode/" style="color:rgb(6, 119, 119);">Cool 
                    Effects with CSS Blend Mode</a>.  It took a lot of trial and error for me to get it to 
                    work, and I also came to learn that both Text Overline & Blend Mode are not supported 
                    in all web browsers.  So unfortunately, this looks a little different in different browers, 
                    which is not ideal.  I love the way it looks on my Mac in Chrome.  I may change this 
                    eventually due to the compatibility issues, but for now I am keeping it, since it took 
                    me so long and I'm rather attached to the design!
